Step 1: Start with a design that uses vanilla JavaScript, then integrate Angular into it.

Step 2: The frontend will initially consist of static pages (HTML, CSS, and JS).

Break these static files into reusable components and bind data to them.

Set up pages and configure routing.

Step 3: Open the design (e.g., index.html) and analyze its structure and contents.

Step 4: The site will begin as a single page, but in the future weâ€™ll expand to multiple templates.

Step 5: Place all static files inside the public folder.

Step 6: html page -> select all -> copy -> paste to app component html files.

Step 7: Take all what is before the <body> tag also with the tag to all what is above from given frontend page and put it in the index html page.
