**Project Name:** Simple Shop Management System  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 06-09-2025  
**Prepared by:** Eng. Abdulrahman Saad

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a simple web-based shop management system that allows:

- One employee to store and update items with details such as **category, photos, and price**.
- Other employees to receive and manually manage **customer orders**.

The system aims to simplify product registration, organize shop inventory, and support efficient handling of customer orders without requiring advanced automation.

---

## 2. Background

Currently, the shop has a very basic manual workflow:

- Products are recorded in spreadsheets or on paper.
- Orders from customers are handled manually without central tracking.
- No unified system exists to store item details or manage orders.

The web system will provide a **central platform** for item storage and order management. This reduces errors, improves accessibility, and ensures consistency in the shopâ€™s operations.

---

## 6. User Stories

- _As an Item Manager, I want to upload product photos so employees can view them when handling orders._
- _As an Order Manager, I want to see pending orders in one list so I can process them efficiently._
- _As an Order Manager, I want to mark an order as completed so the system reflects real-time status._
- _As the shop owner, I want to see reports of items and orders so I can track performance._

---

## 7. Success Metrics

- All items are stored digitally with correct categories and photos.
- Employees can view and update orders without errors.
- Order processing time reduced by at least 30%.
- Zero data loss during employee turnover.

---

## 8. Constraints

- Budget and resources limited (simple system only).
- Single branch, single shop.
- Internet connection required.

---

## 9. Assumptions

- Only internal employees will use the system (no direct customer access).
- Orders are received from outside (phone, chat, or walk-in) and entered manually into the system.

---

## 10. Open Questions

- Should categories be predefined (e.g., _Electronics, Clothes_) or created dynamically by the Item Manager?
- Should employees receive notifications (email, SMS) when new orders arrive?
- Is there a need for a product stock count (inventory tracking)?
